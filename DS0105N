Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions
Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including data science. They involve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced operations like exponentiation and logarithms. In this notebook, we will explore some examples of arithmetic expressions and how they can be used in data science.

# Multiplication
x = 5
y = 10
z = x * y
print(z)
​
# Addition
a = 15
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
​
50
35
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
print("120 minutes is equal to", hours, "hours.")
​
120 minutes is equal to 2.0 hours.
